Greetings! My name is Nomikos Nikolaos, a dedicated student at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), pursuing a degree in Geoinformatics with a focus on becoming a Geomatics Engineer. My academic journey has been complemented by a unique experience at the Hellenic Army Academy, where I successfully completed my training and currently serve as an Army Officer in the Hellenic Military Geographical Service (HMGS).

My professional path intertwines seamlessly with my passion for technology and innovation. I am deeply enthusiastic about programming, particularly skilled in Python and Javascript. My interests extend to the dynamic realms of WebGIS, Remote Sensing, and Deep Learning, where I find joy in navigating the convergence of geospatial data and cutting-edge technology.
